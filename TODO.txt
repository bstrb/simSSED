TODO List
=========
- Simulate orientations of the cell based on orientation matrices
- Include difference of smallest distance (observed vs predicted) in IQM
- Pass ADP to simulation
- Study center sensitivity for simulated data
- Write a script for XGandalf iterations + IQM + merging
- Install Olex, ShelX, Coot
- Make simulations more like real data with center spreading and noise
- Investigate scaling options for merging
- Measure how dynamical a frame is
- Study distribution of intensity for symmetry related reflections
- Apply for grants for other conferences/schools
