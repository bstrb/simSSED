TODO List
=========
simssed:
- Simulate orientations of the cell based on orientation matrices
- Pass ADP to simulation
- Make simulations more like real data with center spreading and noise
icf:
# Study center sensitivity for simulated data
iqm:
- Include difference of smallest distance (observed vs predicted) in IQM
# Write a script for XGandalf iterations + IQM + merging
dynamical effects:
- Investigate scaling options for merging
- Measure how dynamical a frame is
- Study distribution of intensity for symmetry related reflections
general:
- Apply for grants for other conferences/schools
- Install Olex, ShelX, Coot
